### I'm using a CC2530 or CC2531, which firmware should I use?
This depends:
- Zigbee 3.0 firmwares are **not** recommended for the CC2530 and CC2531 (since those are not powerful enough)
- If you have a network of 1 - 15 devices, the Z-Stack_Home_1.2 **default** firmware is recommended.
- If you have a network of 15+ devices, the Z-Stack_Home_1.2 **source routing** firmware is recommended.
- Note that the **source routing** firmware only supports 5 direct children, therefore you need to have routers in range of the coordinator.

### Legend
- *Z-Stack:* Z-Stack is the Zigbee stack for Texas Instruments Zigbee devices
- *Device:* The Zigbee hardware
- *Zigbee:* Zigbee version, for more information read [What's New in Zigbee 3.0](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/swra615a/swra615a.pdf)
- *Direct children:* Number of children that directly can join the coordinator. Note that this is **not** the maximum network size. For more information, read [the Zigbee2MQTT FAQ about device limit](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/faq/#i-read-that-zigbee2mqtt-has-a-limit-of-20-devices-when-using-a-cc2530-cc2531-adapter-is-this-true)
- *Routes:* This indicates how many routes the coordinator can keep in memory. For example 100/200 would mean that: 100 normal routes and 200 source routes can be kept in memory. 0 source routes mean that source routing is disabled. Source routes improve the performance for larger (40+ nodes) networks. For more information read [Large ZigBee Networks and Source Routing
](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001537/references/r_large_zigbee_networks-source_routing.htm?TocPath=Working%20with%20Zigbee%7C_____14).

#### Notes
- Due to new security requirements in Zigbee 3.0, Zigbee 3.0 coordinators can only support a limited amount of Zigbee 3.0 devices. For Zigbee 1.2 coordinators there is no limit on the max number of Zigbee 3.0 devices that can join.

## Compiling the firmware
In case you want to compile the firmware yourself, you can find a `COMPILE.md` for each firmware.

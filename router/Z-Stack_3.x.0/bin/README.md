# Z-Stack 3.x.0 router firmwares

## What firmware to pick for my device?
Same logic as the coordinator firmware applies. See [README.md of the coordinator firmware](../../../coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin/README.md).

## Pairing
After reflashing the router will automatically pair.

## Factory reset
To factory reset single press the button on your device.

Notes:
- Launchpads have 2 buttons, it doesn't matter which one you press
- Slaesh's CC2652RB stick has 2 buttons, press the one furthest away from the USB connector.
- SMLIGHT SLZB-06 adapter - pairing mode activated through web interface: System and Tools - System Control - Router Reconnect
